Scientific writing often contains nuanced expressions of uncertainty—phrases that convey doubt, probability, or conditionality. Identifying and understanding these uncertainties is critical for researchers, reviewers, and readers to accurately interpret scientific claims. The UnScientify project addresses this challenge by leveraging advanced natural language processing to detect and classify scientific uncertainty in texts.

## About the Demo Application

Funded by [French ANR JCJC 2021 - 2025, ANR-21-CE38-0003-01](https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-21-CE38-0003), as a part of [InSciM Project](https://project-inscim.github.io/), the UnScientify demo application offers an interactive interface for users to explore the system’s capabilities firsthand. Designed with simplicity and user experience in mind, the application allows users to input any scientific text and receive immediate annotation of uncertainty expressions present in the content. This real-time feedback provides a practical way to understand how the model interprets language nuances.

The interface features a clean text box for input and dynamically displays annotated results, highlighting uncertain statements directly within the text. This interactive experience supports users from varied backgrounds, from domain experts to curious learners, by making complex model outputs accessible and interpretable.

## Features of the UnScientify Demo

- Real-time annotation: Instantly identifies uncertain phrases and marks them within the input text.

- User-friendly interface: Minimalist and intuitive design suitable for quick testing and exploration.

- Accessibility: Hosted on GitHub and Streamlit for straightforward usage without complicated setup.
