I am a data science enthusiast with a passion for working with text data. This interest complements my bachelor's degree in law, where I became acquainted with the vast amounts of textual data found in the legal and social fields, granting me a unique perspective on how data can be used in the legal and social fields.

I believe that data science is the perfect field for a divergent individual like myself, as it allows for the combination of multiple skills and interests. Therefore, I decided to further my education and obtained my M.Sc. in Research Methodology (Applied Data Science). During this time, I fell in love with text data analysis and the benefits it can bring to the legal and social fields.

Currently, I am a PhD Fellow in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the Lucien Tesnière Research Center - Linguistics and Automatic Language Processing (CRIT) at the University of Bourgogne Franche-Comté in France. Here, I am able to continue my passion for text data analysis and delve deeper into the ways it can be applied to various fields.

Overall, my background in law, passion for research and data science, and love for text data analysis have led me to where I am today and I am excited to see where it will take me in the future.
