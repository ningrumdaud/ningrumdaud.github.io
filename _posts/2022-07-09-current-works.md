Currently, my main activity is working on a French ANR-funded research project called Modeling Uncertainty in Science (InSciM). This project is focused on developing new methods for modeling uncertainty in scientific research and applications. Under the supervision of Dr. Iana Atanassova, I am working on a team of researchers to explore different approaches to modeling uncertainty and evaluating their effectiveness.

The InSciM project is an exciting and challenging endeavor, as it requires me to use my skills in data science, statistics, machine learning, and linguistics to tackle complex problems. I am constantly learning new techniques and methods, as well as collaborating with other researchers to come up with innovative solutions. You can check out the updates of the project on our website: [**here**](https://project-inscim.github.io/) to stay informed about the progress of the project.

In addition to my work on the InSciM project, I am also preparing for my International Doctoral Mobility program at GESIS â€“ Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in Germany. The program is supervised by Dr. Philipp Mayr and will give me the opportunity to work on new research projects, collaborate with researchers from different disciplines and experts from various countries. I am excited about this opportunity to work with Dr. Mayr and the KTS team, as well as to explore the research landscape in Germany. I am looking forward to gaining new insights and perspectives that will help me to further develop my research skills and deepen my understanding of the field of NLP.

Overall, my current activity is a mix of research and professional development. I am working on a challenging and exciting research project, while also preparing for a unique opportunity to gain new insights and perspectives in my field. I am confident that this combination of experiences will help me to achieve my goals and achieve success in my career.
