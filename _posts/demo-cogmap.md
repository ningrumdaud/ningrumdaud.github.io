<h1>CogMapNLP</h1>
  <h3 id="news3">Introduction</h3>
      <p>In this blog post, we will walk through a sample code that demonstrates how to create CogMapNLP, a cognitive map analysis tool from text. Cognitive maps are a great way to visualize and understand the relationships between different concepts. This tool utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and visualize these relationships. </p>

      <p>**1. Lexicon-Based Approach:**
      <p>The tool uses a pre-defined list of causal markers (lexicon) to identify causal expressions within the text. This list includes words and phrases commonly associated with causality, such as "because," "due to," "resulting in," etc.</p>
