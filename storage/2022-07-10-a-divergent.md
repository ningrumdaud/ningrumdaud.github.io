I am a data science enthusiast with a passion for working with text data. This interest complements my bachelor's degree in law, where I became acquainted with the vast amounts of textual data found in the legal and social fields, granting me a unique perspective on how data can be used in the legal and social fields.

I believe that data science is the ideal field for a divergent individual like myself because it allows me to combine multiple skills and interests while also preparing me to approach problems from various perspectives. Therefore, I decided to further my education and obtained my M.Sc. in Research Methodology (Applied Data Science). During this time, I fell in love with text data analysis and the benefits it can bring to the legal and social fields.

Currently, I am a PhD Fellow in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the Lucien Tesnière Research Center - Linguistics and Automatic Language Processing (CRIT) at the University of Bourgogne Franche-Comté in France. Here, I am able to continue my passion for text data analysis and delve deeper into the ways it can be applied to various fields.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy expressing myself through different forms of art. In my spare time, I compose music, write songs, play the guitar, draw, cook, and ride my longboard. You can check out some of my songs on my band's YouTube channel: [here](https://www.youtube.com/@vyasamozarta). All of these activities allow me to unwind and explore different parts of myself, and I believe they help me to be a better and more well-rounded person.

Overall, my academic and personal pursuits have led me to a fulfilling and exciting career in NLP, and I am excited to see where my journey takes me next.
